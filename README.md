# E-E-Cig (WIP)
- ## Project to create an E-cig that doesnâ€™t bring any smoke into a users lungs and instead encourages smoking cessation through a satisfying physical/visual and auditory experience
\\\\
- Uses state machine design for determining whether someone is pulling or not on e-cig
- Includes Ardiuno Code along side Python script to read Serial Monitor
- Early test: https://vimeo.com/767780568
- By end of November will include Unreal Engine VR demo which uses e-cig as controller
